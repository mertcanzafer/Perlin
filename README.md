# Perlin
## **Recommendations:**
- Keep in mind that I will be using graphics pipeline in this project. Therefore, make sure that you have one of the SDKs that SDL3 uses for its rendering backend. Vulkan (SDK) or DirectX (SDK).
- Download Vulkan SDK: (https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
- Download DirectX SDK: (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
  
**Note: If you do not work on Windows, then there is no problem. You can have Vulkan SDK that works on both Windows and Linux, a cross platform API**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements:**
Downloading NASM compiler: SDL_image depends on third-party codecs to decode image/video formats.
### Step 1: Download NASM
  
Go to the official site:
üëâ https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/

Choose the latest version ‚Üí click the Windows or Linux installer link:
### Step 2: Run the installer
- For windows, Double-click the .exe installer
- Install the NASM to a specific directory.
### Step 3: Add NASM to your system PATH
- Use system environment variables to add NASM.
- Verify that you installed NASM
### Step 4: Open a new terminal and run
``` bash
nasm -v
```
If NASM is correctly installed, then you are ready to build the project using CMAKE
